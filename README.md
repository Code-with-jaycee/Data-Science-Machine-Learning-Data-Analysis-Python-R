# Machine Learning

<h3>What is machine Learning?</h3>

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to mimic human learning processes and progressively increase accuracy.
<h3>Traditional Programming vs. Machine learning</h3>

In traditional programming, the precise actions needed to resolve the issue are written down. In contrast, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) known as machine learning is driven by the way humans learn; we just provide examples and let the computer work out the solution on its own.
<h3>How Machine will Learn like Human Learning?</h3>

Humans learn via experience, whether their own or that of others. Machines learn via shared experience in the form of historical data.

<h3>Machine Learning vs. Statistics</h3>

Statistics infers population inferences from a sample, whereas machine learning discovers generalizable prediction patterns. Inference and prediction are two fundamental goals in the study of biological systems.

<h3>Machine Learning engineer responsibilities</h3>

Machine learning engineers play an important role on the data science team. Their responsibilities include studying, developing, and creating the artificial intelligence that drives machine learning, as well as maintaining and improving current artificial intelligence systems.

<h3>Type of machine learning</h3>

- Supervised
- semi-supervised
- unsupervised
- reinforcement.



# Numpy

Numpy is an open source library in python that used in mathematical, statistical operation, scientific, engineering and data science programming.
